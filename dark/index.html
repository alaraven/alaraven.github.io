                            <p>All clients will receive a <strong>FREE</strong> consultation prior to commiting to the project. During this meeting we will discuss the project and review the contract. Ideally, we will have this meeting on zoom, if this is not possible no worries! We can do a phone/video call elsewhere.</p>
                        <h3>Contract/Payment</h3>
                            <p>Before the project begins the contract must be signed by both parties and 100% payment made. This will happen after our consultation/agreement to pursue the project. Projects will begin on a first come/first served basis, this means that your spot won't be guaranteed until this phase is complete.</p>
                        <h3>Design</h3>
                            <p>All the required files/photos/visions must be acquired before this phase begins. The more detailed your vision the better/less revisions needed. Branding services(logo, business cards, etc) are offered.</p>
                        <h3>Development</h3>
                            <p>This is where the magic happens! This is the foundation of the project and requires the most time. Timelines are project dependent.
                            </p>
                        <h3>Completion</h3>
                            <p>You will be notified once the project is complete. We offer 1 complimentary revision, all following revisions will be charged at $50/hour. Maintenance services are available upon request and charged hourly ($50/hour).</p>
